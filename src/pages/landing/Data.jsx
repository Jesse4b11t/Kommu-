If a potential swap is planned between properties of different point values, the difference in points must be made up between the parties in order to execute the swap.',

        answer: 'Short term home swapping does not violate the terms of most rental agreements with regards to subletting or vacation rentals because there is no money exchanged in the swap and each party continues to pay rent on their primary residence. We encourage all members to check their lease before joining our platform, check local and state laws regarding occupancy, and consult a lawyer if they have questions.',
